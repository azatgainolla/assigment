I used OpenWeatherMap API to get weather information.The application takes the city name as input from the user and displays the weather description and temperature in both Kelvin (K) and Celsius (Â°C).

To create this application, I used the Apache HttpClient library to send HTTP requests and the JSON library to parse the JSON responses received from the API.
The application will make an API request to OpenWeatherMap and display a weather description and temperature in Kelvin and Celsius.
Temperature is first measured in Kelvin and then converted to Celsius.
If weather data for the specified city is not found, the application will display an appropriate error message.
